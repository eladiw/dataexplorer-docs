# !~ (not equals) operator

Filters a record set for data that does not match a case-insensitive string.

The following table provides a comparison of the `==` (equals) operators:

|Operator   |Description   |Case-Sensitive  |Example (yields `true`)  |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|-------------------------|
|[`==`](equals-cs-operator.md)|Equals |Yes|`"aBc" == "aBc"`|
|[`!=`](not-equals-cs-operator.md)|Not equals |Yes |`"abc" != "ABC"`|
|[`=~`](equals-operator.md) |Equals |No |`"abc" =~ "ABC"`|
|[`!~`](not-equals-operator.md) |Not equals |No |`"aBc" !~ "xyz"`|

For further information about other operators and to determine which operator is most appropriate for your query, see [datatype string operators](datatypes-string-operators.md). 

Case-insensitive operators are currently supported only for ASCII-text. For non-ASCII comparison, use the [tolower()](tolowerfunction.md) function.

## Performance tips

> [!NOTE]
> Performance depends on the type of search and the structure of the data.

For faster results, use the case-sensitive version of an operator, for example, `==`, not `=~`.

If you're testing for the presence of a symbol or alphanumeric word that is bound by non-alphanumeric characters at the start or end of a field, for faster results use `has` or `in`. 

For best practices, see [Query best practices](best-practices.md).

## Syntax

*T* `|` `where` *col* `!~` `(`*expression*`)` 

## Arguments

* *T* - The tabular input whose records are to be filtered.
* *col* - The column to filter.
* *expression* - Scalar or literal expression.

## Returns

Rows in *T* for which the predicate is `true`.

## Example

```kusto
StormEvents
    | summarize event_count=count() by State
    | where (State !~ "texas") and (event_count > 3000)
    | project State, event_count
```

**Output**

|State|event_count|
|-----|-----------|
|KANSAS|3,166|
